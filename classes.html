    <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>

    <p>
      Prepare yourself forr savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at
      your side with palms up. Cloase your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink
      into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are ready, roll on your
      side and use your arms to puush yourself to a sitting position with crossed legs.
      Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you haave in life.
      Namaste.
    </p>
